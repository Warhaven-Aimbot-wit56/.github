## 🧠 What Is a Warhaven Aimbot?

A **Warhaven aimbot** is a cheat that automatically aims for you — locking your crosshair on enemy players using logic like FOV (field of view), bone targeting, visibility checks, and smoothness sliders. It’s especially powerful for:

* 🏹 **Bow users / Ranged weapons**
* 🔮 **Projectile casters / Magic classes**
* 🧠 **One-shot potential headshots**

And when paired with **silent aim**, it becomes basically **undetectable** to spectators 👀
